        <h2>1 - Be prepared</h2>
        <p>The best thing you can do to make a good first impression during an interview is to be well-prepared for the interview when you arrive. Before your interview, research the company and know what they do, what your responsibility would be in the position you are applying for, what the company’s core values are and how you can add value to the company. Showing you have done your research can leave the interviewer with the impression that you are serious about the position you have applied to.</p>

        <h2>2 - Arrive on time</h2>
        <p>Arriving at your interview on-time sets the tone of professionalism the interviewer can expect from you. In fact, it is best to arrive at least five to 10 minutes early to show the interviewer that punctuality is something you value. The interviewer and hiring manager will expect you to be reliable and punctual in your role, so being on-time or early to the interviewer gives the impression they can trust you to be on-time for your new job.</p>

It is important to stand tall, sit-up straight, hold your head up and keep your shoulders back throughout your interview. Good posture gives an impression of confidence and professionalism. You should also be sure to maintain eye contact with the interviewer throughout your meeting..</p>

        <p>Many people form their first impression of you within just a few minutes of meeting you. When you first meet the interviewer it is important to offer a warm and friendly greeting with a professional introduction and firm handshake. Your greeting should include a friendly smile and a clear introduction of who you are. </p>
